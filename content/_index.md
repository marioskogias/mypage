I'm a researcher in the [Confidential Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/) group at MSR Cambridge.
During my PhD I worked with [Ed Bugnion](https://people.epfl.ch/edouard.bugnion) in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) as part of [DCSL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcsl/) supported by an [IBM PhD Fellowship](https://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships.html).
I led the [TTL-MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/swiss-joint-research-center/#!projects) Microsoft Swiss JRC program.

Before joining EPFL, I did my undergrad in Electical and Computer Engineering in [NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). For my thesis I worked on [storage tracing](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/dev/blkin/).

My research focuses on datacenters and latency-critical systems in the micro-second scale.
I build systems with strict tail-latency SLOs by redesigning operating systems mechanisms, e.g. scheduling, and network protocols to take advantage of fast commodity IO devices and in-network compute.
